  "body": "<p>This weekend, a new biopic opens in America about Marie Colvin, a <em>Sunday Times<\/em> correspondent killed six years ago in Syria while reporting on the civil war. In the film, Rosamund Pike plays one of the most courageous journalists of the 21st century: Colvin escaped from Chechnya across a mountain range; refused to leave a UN compound alongside 1,500 refugees in East Timor as Indonesian troops descended; and lost her eye in Sri Lanka after a soldier threw a grenade her way. Driven by a compulsion to chronicle what she termed \u201chumanity in extremis\u201d, her final piece reported from the \u201cwidows\u2019 basement\u201d in Homs, the city she later died in, a cellar where 300 women and children sheltered as shells rained down outside. Today, as newspapers ditch their expensive foreign correspondents, and as more people learn unreliable truths about conflicts from social media, Colvin\u2019s type is needed more than ever.<\/p>\n",

  "body": "<p>For bookworms, the adaptation of a favourite novel is both a thrilling and nerve-wracking prospect. For Elena Ferrante, the translation of her novels into spoken dialogue is, as she has written, \u201ctraumatic\u201d. This weekend, the pseudonymous Ms Ferrante and her fans will find out if the televised adaptation of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d, the first of her acclaimed Neapolitan novels, merited the anxiety. The eight-part programme follows the hardscrabble childhoods of Elena, the shy, scholarly narrator, and Lila, her fiery, creative best friend, in Naples during the 1950s. Given its setting, the cast speak in the Neapolitan dialect (which plays a significant role in the story), so even Italians will require subtitles. Readers have become entranced by the intense female friendship portrayed in Ms Ferrante\u2019s quartet of novels\u2014an obsession, dubbed \u201cFerrante fever\u201d, that is sure to spread further thanks to the rapturous critical reception of \u201cMy Brilliant Friend\u201d. That fever shows no sign of breaking.<\/p>\n",

  "body": "<p>\u201cThe more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is,\u201d said Ad Reinhardt. His reductive \u201cblack paintings\u201d\u2014canvases made up of squares of faintly different shades\u2014are considered a progenitor of the minimalist movement; his comments are often cited when defining it. Turning away from the emphasis on emotion and the subconscious espoused by the Abstract Expressionists, minimalist artists sought simplicity and objectivity, geometric forms and industrial materials. They wanted the artwork to exist in and of itself, rather than refer to or replicate. In the biggest exhibition of its kind in South-East Asia, 150 works spread across the National Gallery and the ArtScience Museum in Singapore explore the significance of the movement from the 1950s to the modern day. Though minimalism originated in New York and spread to Europe and Asia, the show will highlight how eastern philosophies such as Zen Buddhism were influential in return.<\/p>\n",

The units of mass (kilogram), current (ampere), temperature (kelvin) and the amount of a chemical substance (mole) will be redefined in terms of the values of physical constants. The metre, second and candela (a unit of luminosity) have already been so revised. The changes will mean all seven base units of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris can, in theory, be reproduced at any time and in any place. The change is most significant for the kilogram, the last unit to be defined by a physical object\u2014a cylinder of platinum-iridium alloy held in a vault since 1889. Instead, Planck\u2019s constant, which relates to the power required to support a given mass, will be fixed very precisely, meaning any laboratory with the right kit will be able to measure a kilo itself.<\/p>\n",

The Norwegian\u2019s match in London against Fabiano Caruana, an Italian-American, stands at 2\u00bd-2\u00bd, with seven games to go. Mr Carlsen has been ranked the world\u2019s top player for eight consecutive years. He achieved the highest rating in history, 2,882, aged just 23. He has mostly breezed through the games so far\u2014all draws. Fans hope that the contest between two young players will rejuvenate interest in the game. At 25, Mr Caruana is even younger than his opponent. He became a grandmaster at 14 and has dreamed of becoming the first American world chess champion since Bobby Fischer ever since. But the days when chess\u2019s grand contests like Fischer v Spassky captured the world\u2019s imagination are long behind it. <\/p>\n",
